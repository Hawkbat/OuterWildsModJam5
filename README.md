A barren world carries the seeds of rebirth.

Submission for the 15-day [July 2025 Mod Jam](https://outerwildsmods.com/jam/jul-2025/)!

Access the mod by finding the platform with the pink flower and using the warp pad there, or by flying the ship to the planet Lonely Lump.

The [Suit Log](https://outerwildsmods.com/mods/suitlog/) mod by Dami√°n Garro is recommended but not required.
